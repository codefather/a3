# a3

a3 module loads any folder of code into an 'API Tree'.

## Installation

    npm install a3


    
## Quick Start

First, require `a3`:

```coffee-script
  a3 = require('a3')
```

Next :

```coffee
    apiTree = a3.buildApiTree('./app')
    
```

Options: 

```coffee
    options:
        moduleLoadedCallback: customCallback #(default callback loads all export methods of module)
        allowDirectoryConflicts: true #(default is false, and throws exception when dir tree confilct found)
    
    apiTree = a3.buildApiTree('./app', options)
    
```

## Simple example:

Assuming we've got following code folders structure:

```coffee-script
    api\comments.coffee
    
    api\posts.coffee
    
    api\users.coffee
    
    api\admin\users.coffee
    
    api\admin\comments.coffee
```
With following file contents:
  
api\comments.coffee

```coffee
  exports.list  ->
    ## some code
  exports.add(comment)  ->
    ## some code
```

api\posts.coffee

```coffee
  exports.list  ->
    ## some code
  exports.add(post)  ->
    ## some code
```

api\users.coffee

```coffee
  exports.list  ->
    ## some code
  exports.add(user)  ->
    ## some code
```

api\admin\users.coffee

```coffee
  exports.list  ->
    ## some code
  exports.remove(user)  ->
    ## some code
```
api\admin\comments.coffee

```coffee
  exports.list  ->
    ## some code
  exports.remove(comment)  ->
    ##  some code
    
```
Invoke buildApiTree on api folder :

```coffee
    api = a3.buildApiTree('./api')
```

It will return following object with all modules in provided code folder loaded:

```coffee

{ 
    comments:{ 
                list: [Function],
                add: [Function] 
             },
      posts: { 
                list: [Function],
                add: [Function] 
             },
      users: {
                list: [Function],
                add: [Function] 
             },
      admin: { users:{ 
                          list: [Function],
                          remove: [Function] 
                     },
               comments:{
                          list: [Function],
                          remove: [Function] 
               
                     } 
              }
}

```
